    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>You won't believe how chocolate-y and moist these brownies are. I like to make them in mini muffin cups with mini foil cupcake liners. Dust them with powdered sugar and you have a decadent treat with the benefit of more protein, more fiber, and fewer fat calories.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
           <li>1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained</li>
           <li>1 cup water</li>
           <li>1 package brownie mix/li>
           <li>1 cup chocolate chips, divided</li>  
        </ul>
    <h1>Recipe</h1>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1</strong> Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2</strong> Blend black beans and water together in a blender until smooth; pour into a bowl. Stir brownie mix into black bean mixture until batter is smooth; fold in 1/2 cup chocolate chips. Pour batter into prepared baking dish. Sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup chocolate chips over batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3</strong> Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted 2 inches from the side of the pan comes out clean, 25 to 27 minutes. Cool brownies completely on a wire rack before cutting into squares. I Made It</li>
