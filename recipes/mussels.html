<p>This is a simple recipe. Most of the work is preparing the mussels; cooking takes very little time. When you have finished eating the mussels, dip bread in the buttery wine sauce.</p>
<h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>4 quarts mussels, cleaned and debearded</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>Â¼ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>2 cups white wine</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
    </ul>
<h1>Recipe</h1>
    <ol>
       <li><strong>Step 1</strong> Scrub mussels. Pull off beards, the tuft of fibers that attach each mussel to it's shell, cutting them at the base with a paring knife. Discard those that do not close when you handle them and any with broken shells. Set aside.</li>
       <li><strong>Step 2</strong> Combine onion, garlic, 4 tablespoons parsley, bay leaf, thyme, wine, and 2 tablespoons butter in large pot. Bring to boil. Lower heat, and cook 2 minutes. Add mussels, and cover. Cook just until shells open, 3 to 4 minutes. Do not overcook. Remove mussels from sauce, and place in bowls.</li> 
       <li><strong>Step 3</strong> Strain liquid, and return to pot. Add remaining butter and parsley. Heat until butter melts. Pour over mussels. I Made It</li>
